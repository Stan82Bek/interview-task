- `BasePage` should be the parent class of all page classes.
- All page classes must be initialized in `globalPagesSetup.js` for efficient element location.

### 4. `steps` Folder
Holds step definitions matching the respective feature file names.

### 5. `.env` File
Stores necessary environment variables for the automation project. This file should be created at the root level.

### 6. `cucumber.cjs` File
A CommonJS configuration file for CucumberJS, managing settings for BDD-style tests, including:
- Step definitions
